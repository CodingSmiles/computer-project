## Authors's notes
For anyone who stumbles upon this (highly unlikely), I made this as a school project.
I'm currently 13 in 2023 and this was one project I had to make for the CS. I went a bit over the expectations mostly because I'm an avid programmer and app-dev guy. I think it paid off because the website is really not too bad in my opinion. If anyone has any suggestions or things that I could improve, please create an issue. I'm active here so I won't ignore it. Thanks!
